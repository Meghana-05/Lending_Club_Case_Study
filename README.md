To conclude, major driving factors indicating tendency to default are:
- Grade, Tenure and Purpose of loan
- Verification Status and Home-ownership of applicant
- Annual Income To Loan Ratio and DTI of applicant

## Recommendations:
Long term loans are defaulted more often; hence such applications must be scrutinized thoroughly.
Clients opting for low grade loan have higher tendency to default, hence several other factors (like employment experience, source income verification, term of loan, DTI) must be closely analyzed while approving such loans.
Having Public Recorded Bankruptcy can be good indicator of future default.
Applicants with very high Debt to Income ratio or Loan to Annual Income ratio can cause greater credit loss to Lending Club.
Applications for small business loans must be examined in detail as they have higher rate to default. 
Analysis of location and home ownership (esp. Mortgage and Rent) is to be considered for future loan approvals.
